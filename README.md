# web-game-new
This is continuation of web-game repository.  
I created this becouse my old project is too bad (maybe not all but majority).

## THIS PROJECT IS NOT ALREADY FINISH!

### What is it?
The project is my great game idea like OGame or Travian.  
I try use my whole experience in programing to make really good code.  
I have one year experience in python and I thing that I can create some bigger project than calculator.  
I want to study programing and become professional programist.  

### How it works?
User after register and create his first colony will be player of the game. There are three systems:

- Building system is standard system, you have resources to start build and time to wait. Buildings on higher level create more resources. When you build forge you can make some tools or weapons.  

- Tools system adds bonus to the production. For example saw add 20% to production of wood for 45 min. Weapons can make soldiers in barracks.  

- Army system is main element of game. Players use his army to start mini game, something like chees. Palyer has to end the game to end atack. When player send his army to other player, the game has begins. Both players move to new page where will fight. The game start only when both players be ready. The winner receives resources form loser.
