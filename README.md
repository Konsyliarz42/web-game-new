# web-game-new
This is continuation of web-game repository.  
I created this becouse my old project is too bad (maybe not all but majority).

## THIS PROJECT IS NOT ALREADY FINISH!

### What is it?
The project is my great game idea like OGame or Travian.  
I try use my whole experience in programing to make really good code.  
I have one year experience in python and I thing that I can create some bigger project than calculator.  
I want to study programing and become professional programist.  

### What do we can?
Every User after register has to go to the user's profile page and click on "create new colony".  
When name of colony is corect User can go to main colony page.  
Now User can build and store resources like wood or stone.

### What will added?
- New constructions (for example Mine or Barracks)
- Tools system (Tool adds bonus to production or something)
- Multiple colonies (User has few independent colonies)
- Army (User can attack other players)
- CSS and JavaScript
- API (Game receives REST API for developers)
